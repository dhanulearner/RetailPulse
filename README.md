# E-Commerce Insights: Data-Driven Performance Analysis
## E-Commerce Data Analysis Using Python Libraries
This project uses Python programming to analyze and visualize real-world e-commerce data. It focuses on understanding customer behavior, sales performance, and order trends by analyzing key metrics such as total sales, order quantity, product categories, and customer distribution. By cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, the project extracts meaningful patterns and trends that help in better business understanding. Visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and summary tables simplify the analysis and make insights easy to interpret. Overall, this project serves as a strong learning resource for data analysis using Python.
